# The goal of this project is to show how different campaigns fared in the Kickstarter program.The purpose is to show results based on a launch date or a goals set on the funding, and to give Louise enough detailed information to produce more successful programs.

### The analysis was performed using the Kickstarter dataset. Information was pulled from the dataset to show results that can be narrowed down to a specific item. We can show a location and all successful plays from that location, or we can check goals and compare to pledged. Using pivot tables information can be gleaned, and necessary to make educated business decisions and produce more plays that can become successful. A possible challenge would be to narrow the search to a region within a country.

### We see in the **Theater Outcomes by Launch Date** chart shown below that as we head into spring the number of successful plays coincides with the number of plays produced, and the number of fails also rises. We also see that heading into winter the percentage of successful plays drop. We can conclude from this information that plays are more successful in the spring and start to decline in the summer.

### We see in the **Outcomes based on Goals** chart shown below the trends on the funding goal. This tells us that above a certain dollar amount the goals are not successful, and the most successful plays are in the range of 1000 to 4999.

## We have some limitation in the dataset, in that we do not list regions, and we could create a table to show average donation to goals, we could also run a table to show a goal amount depending on month of the year.
