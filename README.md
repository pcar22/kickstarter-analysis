## The aim of this project is to demonstrate the performance of various Kickstarter campaigns, by analyzing their launch dates or funding goals. The objective is to provide Louise with comprehensive data that can be utilized to create more effective programs.  

### The Kickstarter dataset was utilized to conduct the analysis. Relevant information was extracted from the dataset to generate specific results. For instance, data can be filtered by location to showcase successful plays in that area, or by comparing funding goals to the amount pledged. Pivot tables were utilized to extract pertinent information, which is crucial for making informed business decisions and developing successful plays. However, a potential challenge could be restricting the search to a particular region within a country.

### As depicted in the chart titled **Theater Outcomes by Launch Date** below, there is a correlation between the number of successful plays and the season of launch. During spring, the number of successful plays increases along with the total number of plays launched, while the number of failures also rises. Conversely, as we approach winter, the percentage of successful plays declines. Based on this data, it can be inferred that plays tend to have better success rates during spring, but this trend starts to decline during summer.

### The chart titled **Outcomes based on Goal** below demonstrates the patterns relating to funding goals. It reveals that beyond a certain dollar amount, the goals tend to be unsuccessful. On the other hand, the most successful plays fall within the range of $1000 to $4999.

## The dataset has certain limitations, such as the absence of regional information. To overcome this limitation, we could create a table that displays the average donation per funding goal. Additionally, we could run a table that indicates the optimal funding goal based on the month of the year.
